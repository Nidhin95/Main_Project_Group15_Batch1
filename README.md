ABSTRACT


    Most organisations employ customer relationship management system to provide a strategic advantage over their competitors.
    One aspect of this is applying a customer lifetime value (CLTV) to each client. Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) 
    is an important metric which helps in making decisions about how much money to invest in acquiring new customers and
    retaining existing ones. Knowing CLTV helps to build marketing strategies with a positive Return on Investment (ROI). In this project,
    we are experimenting with a real world dataset that represents Customer Lifetime Value of an Auto Insurance Company which includes 
    24 features and 9134 records, and to explore how machine learning algorithms can be used to find patterns in data. Also we expect to
    gain experience using various data visualisation tools, common machine learning techniques and try to build various regression models to
    accurately predict the Customer Lifetime Value.
